## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern communication networks consume significant energy due to the rapid growth of cloud computing, IoT systems, and data-intensive services. Traditional routing algorithms typically optimize latency or hop count while ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions.

This project implements a quantum-inspired routing optimization framework that integrates:
* **⚡ Energy consumption**
* **🌍 Carbon intensity**
* **⏱ Network latency**

...into a multi-objective routing cost function. 

The routing problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model inspired by quantum optimization methods such as QAOA. The optimization itself is executed using classical computation within MATLAB, allowing evaluation of quantum-inspired strategies without requiring quantum hardware. 

The framework simulates network routing using a Waxman topology model and evaluates performance across 300 traffic flows.

## 🧠 Routing Algorithms

### 1. Shortest Path Routing
A classical routing strategy that minimizes latency using Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the minimum-cost path between nodes.
> **Cost = Latency**

### 2. Energy-Aware Routing
Extends shortest-path routing by incorporating link-level energy consumption into routing decisions. This method favors routes that reduce electrical power consumption while maintaining reasonable latency.
> **Cost = w₁ · Latency + w₂ · Energy**

### 3. Quantum-Inspired Routing
A multi-objective routing optimization approach inspired by quantum algorithms such as QAOA. The routing objective integrates latency, energy consumption, and carbon intensity into a single QUBO optimization model. Candidate paths are evaluated using classical computation to identify routes that minimize the combined sustainability cost.
> **F = α · Latency + β · Energy + γ · Carbon**
